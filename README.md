# Charles' first Java script for testing
## Description
This was one of my projects maintained while I was in Planit bootcamp training. Due to the very limited number in Planit Git, I have to move it here.

I can use this script as a template for all my automation test script in Java.
## Before running
### Make sure Maven is correctly downloaded and configured before we run the scripts
- First we need to set the path for Java JDK and Maven in system variables;

### Important update notes on 2019/08/16
Update the <groupId> and <artifactId> in "pom.xml" file, as incorrect value for those XML elements will lead to failure.
